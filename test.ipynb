But in real life these kinds of description can add to\\nlot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description\\nof the solution.\\nThere are several ways by which we can describe the concentration\\nof the solution quantitatively.\\n(i)Mass percentage ( w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a\\nsolution is defined as:\\nMass % of a component\\n= \\uf0b4Mass of the component in the solution 100\\nTotal mass of the solution(1.1)\\nFor example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by\\nmass, it means that 10 g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water\\nresulting in a 100 g solution.

While sodium chloride\\nand sugar dissolve r eadily in water , naphthalene and anthracene do\\nnot. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in\\nbenzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that\\npolar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in non-\\npolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the\\nintermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like\\ndissolves like .\\nWhen a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves\\nand its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as\\ndissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute\\nparticles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as\\ncrystallisation . A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the\\nsame rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going\\ninto solution  will be equal to the solute particles separating out and\\na state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.\\nSolute + Solvent ⇌ Solution (1.10)\\nAt this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain\\nconstant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure.\\nSimilar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents.\\nSuch a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same\\ntemperature and pressure is called a saturated solution . An\\nunsaturated solution  is one in which more solute can be dissolved at\\nthe same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium\\nwith undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the\\nmaximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.\\nThus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.\\nEarlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into\\nanother depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these\\nvariables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also\\ncontrol this phenomenon.\\nEffect of temperature\\nThe solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature\\nchanges. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This,\\nbeing dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle.  In\\ngeneral, if in a nearly saturated solution,  the dissolution process is\\nendothermic ( Dsol H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in\\ntemperature and if it is exothermic ( Dsol H<0) the solubility should\\ndecrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.\\nEffect of pressure\\nPressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in\\nliquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible\\nand practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure.\\nMany gases dissolve in water .

The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure.\\nFor solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in\\nFig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous\\nsystem at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in\\na state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of\\ngaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same.\\nNow increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the\\ngas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of\\ngaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate\\nat which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to\\nenter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium\\nis reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the\\nsolution and thus its solubility increases.\\nHenry was the first to give a\\nquantitative relation between\\npressure and solubility of a gas in\\na solvent which is known as\\nHenry’s law . The law states that\\nat a constant temperature, the\\nsolubility of a gas in a liquid is\\ndirectly proportional to the\\npartial pressure of the gas\\npresent above the surface of\\nliquid or solution. Dalton, a\\ncontemporary of Henry, also\\nconcluded independently that the\\nsolubility of a gas in a liquid\\nsolution is a function of partial\\npressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in\\nthe solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be\\nsaid that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is\\nproportional to the partial pressure of the gas over\\nthe solution.  The most commonly used form of Henry’s\\nlaw states that “ the partial pressure of the gas in\\nvapour phase ( p) is proportional to the mole fraction\\nof the gas ( x) in the solution”  and is expressed  as:\\np = KH x (1.11)\\nHere KH is the Henry’s law constant. If we draw a\\ngraph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole\\nfraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot\\nof the type as shown in Fig. 1.2.\\nDifferent gases have different KH values at the same\\ntemperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that KH is a\\nfunction of the nature of the gas.\\nIt is obvious from equation ( 1.11) that higher the\\nvalue of KH at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility\\nof the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1.2\\nthat KH values for both N2 and O2 increase with increase\\nof temperature indicating that the solubility of gasesFig. 1.1: Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas.

In the solution of a gas in a\\nliquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and\\nwe have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry’s law which\\nstates that\\np = KH x.\\nIf we compare the equations for Raoult’s law and Henry’s law, it\\ncan be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas\\nis directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the\\nproportionality constant KH differs from p10. Thus, Raoult’s law becomes\\na special case of Henry’s law in which KH becomes equal to p10.\\nAnother important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in\\nliquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in\\nwater and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some\\nphysical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of\\npure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given\\ntemperature vapourise and under\\nequilibrium conditions the pressure exerted\\nby the vapours of the liquid over the liquid\\nphase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)].\\nIn a pure liquid the entire surface is\\noccupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a\\nnon-volatile solute is added to a solvent to\\ngive a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour\\npressure of the solution is solely from the\\nsolvent alone. This vapour pressure of the\\nsolution at a given temperature is found to\\nbe lower than the vapour pressure of the\\npure solvent at the same temperature. In\\nthe solution, the surface has both solute and\\nsolvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the\\nsurface covered by the solvent molecules gets\\nreduced. Consequently, the number of\\nsolvent molecules escaping from the surface\\nis correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour\\npressure is also reduced.\\nThe decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the\\nquantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of\\nits nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by\\nadding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that\\nproduced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at\\nthe same temperature.\\nRaoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution\\nthe partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the\\nsolution is directly proportional to its mole fraction .\\nIn a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by\\n2.

The ideal solutions have\\ntwo other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the\\npure components to form the solution is zero and the volume\\nof mixing is also zero, i.e.,\\nDmixH = 0, DmixV = 0 (1.21)\\nIt means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components\\nare mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of\\nvolumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of\\nthe solutions can be explained by considering two components A and\\nB. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will\\nbe of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition\\nto these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present.\\nIf the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are\\nnearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal\\nsolution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly\\nideal in behaviour . Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, br omoethane\\nand chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category.\\nWhen a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of\\nconcentration, then it is called non-ideal solution . The vapour pressure\\nof such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by\\nRaoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher , the solution exhibits positive\\ndeviation  and if it is lower , it exhibits negative deviation  from Raoult’s\\nlaw. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions\\nfor such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6.\\nThe cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the\\nmolecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B\\ninteractions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case\\nthe intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules\\nare weaker than  those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent\\nmolecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will\\nfind it easier to escape than in pure state.

Due to weakening of\\ninteractions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law\\n[Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to\\nacetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are\\nweaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and\\nsolvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation.\\nIn case of negative deviations from Raoult’s law, the intermolecular\\nattractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between\\nA-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative\\ndeviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline.\\nIn this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic\\nproton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the\\nrespective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar\\nmolecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone\\nforms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult’s law.\\nThis is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen\\nbond with acetone molecule as shown.\\nThis decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each\\ncomponent and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting\\nin negative deviation from Raoult’s law [Fig. 1.6.

Membranes having this kind\\nof properties are known as semipermeable membranes  (SPM).\\nAssume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semi-\\npermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent\\nand solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through\\nthe membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow\\nof the solvent is called osmosis .\\nThe flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the\\nsolvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane\\ncan be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. \\nThis\\npressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic\\npressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to\\nthe concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to\\nosmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules\\nalways flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution.\\nThe osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration\\nof the solution.\\n The osmotic pressure of a solution is the\\nexcess pressure that must be applied to a\\nsolution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the\\npassage of solvent molecules through a\\nsemipermeable membrane into the solution. This\\nis illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a\\ncolligative property as it depends on the number\\nof solute molecules and not on their identity.\\nFor dilute solutions, it has been found\\nexperimentally that osmotic pressure is\\nproportional to the molarity, C of the\\nsolution at a given temperature T . Thus:\\nP = C R T (1.39)\\nHere P is the osmotic pressure and R is the\\ngas constant.\\nP = (n2 /V) R T (1.40)\\nHere V is volume of a solution in litres containing n2 moles of solute.\\nIf w2 grams of solute, of molar mass, M2 is present in the solution, then\\nn2 = w2 / M2 and we can write,\\nP V =2\\n2  \\n wR T\\nM(1.41)\\norM2 =∏2  wR T\\nV(1.42)\\nThus, knowing the quantities w2, T, P and V we can calculate the\\nmolar mass of the solute.\\nMeasurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of\\ndetermining molar masses of solutes.

The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over\\nother methods as pressure measurement is around the room\\ntemperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality.\\nAs compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large\\neven for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for\\ndetermination  of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for\\nbiomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures\\nand polymers have poor solubility.\\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given\\ntemperature are called isotonic solutions . When such solutions\\nare separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs\\nbetween them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated\\nwith the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of\\n0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline\\nsolution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if\\nwe place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/\\nvolume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they\\nwould shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic . If the salt\\nconcentration is less than 0.9% (mass/volume), the solution is said\\nto be hypotonic . In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed\\nin this solution and they would swell.\\n200 cm3 of an aqueous solution of a protein contains 1.26 g of the\\nprotein.

Solutions are\\nclassified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is\\nexpressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The\\ndissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s law , according to which, at a\\ngiven temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to\\nthe partial pressure of the gas . The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by\\nthe presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour\\npressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult’s law, according to which the relative\\nlowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole\\nfraction of a non-volatile solute pr esent in the solution . However , in a binary\\nliquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another\\nform of Raoult’s law is used.

The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure\\nhigher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties\\nhave been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in\\nsolution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which\\nassociate show higher molar mass than their actual values.\\nQuantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be\\nexpressed by van’t Hoff factor i.

In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous\\nredox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for\\nrunning a motor or other electrical gadgets  like heater , fan,\\ngeyser , etc.\\nDaniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following\\nredox reaction occurs.\\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\\nThis reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition\\ngives the overall cell reaction:\\n(i)Cu2+   +  2e–    ® Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2)\\n(ii)Zn(s)  ® Zn2+ + 2e–(oxidation half reaction) (2.3)\\nThese reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.\\nThe reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the\\noxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions\\nof the cell are also called \\nhalf-cells  or redox couples . The copper\\nelectrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,\\nthe oxidation half-cell.\\nWe can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the patter n\\nof Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half-\\ncell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two\\nhalf-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a\\nswitch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected\\ninternally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1.  Sometimes, both\\nthe electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we\\ndo not require a salt bridge.\\nAt each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal\\nions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make\\nit positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode\\nhave a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the\\nelectrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At\\nequilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the\\ntendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively\\nor negatively charged with  respect to the solution. A potential difference\\ndevelops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called\\nelectrode potential . When the concentrations of all the species involved\\nin a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard\\nelectrode potential . According to IUPAC convention, standard\\nreduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a\\ngalvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode\\nand it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other\\nhalf-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a\\npositive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a\\npotential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the\\nswitch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode\\nto positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of\\nelectron flow.2.2 Galvanic Cells2.2 Galvanic Cells2.2 Galvanic Cells2.2 Galvanic Cells2.2 Galvanic Cells\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Doc\\\\lech102.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='34 ChemistryThe potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic\\ncell is called the cell potential  and is measured in volts. The cell\\npotential  is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction\\npotentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive\\nforce (emf)  of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It\\nis now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and\\nthe cathode on the right  while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic\\ncell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal\\nand electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between\\nthe two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge.  Under this convention\\nthe emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half-\\ncell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the\\nleft hand side i.e. ,\\nEcell = Eright  – Eleft\\nThis is illustrated by the following example:\\nCell reaction:\\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ¾® Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4)\\nHalf-cell reactions:\\nCathode (reduction ):   2Ag+(aq) + 2e– ® 2Ag(s) (2.5)\\nAnode (oxidation ):    Cu(s)  ® Cu2+(aq) + 2e–(2.6)\\nIt can be seen that  the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to  overall reaction\\n(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper\\nelectrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:\\nCu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)\\nand we have Ecell = \\nEright – Eleft = EAg+úAg – ECu2+úCu(2.7)\\nThe potential of individual half-cell cannot be measur ed. W e can\\nmeasure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that\\ngives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one\\nelectrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect\\nto this.

The\\nreverse pr ocess cannot occur , that is, hydr ogen ions cannot oxidise Cu\\n(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)\\nunder the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not\\ndissolve in HCl.  In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by\\nhydrogen ion.  The negative value of the standard electrode potential\\nin the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or\\nzinc can reduce hydrogen ions).\\nIn view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in\\nFig. 2.1 can be written as:\\nLeft electrode: Zn(s) ® Zn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e–\\nRight electrode: Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e– ® Cu(s)\\nThe overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions\\nand we obtain the equation:\\nZn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\\nemf of the cell = Eo\\ncell= Eo\\nR – Eo\\nL\\n= 0.34V – (– 0.76)V = 1.10 V\\nSometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes.\\nThey do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for\\noxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons.\\nFor example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:\\nHydrogen electrode:  Pt(s)|H2(g)| H+(aq)\\nWith half-cell reaction:  H+ (aq)+ e– ® ½ H2(g)\\nBromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br2(aq)| Br–(aq)\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",

If the standard electrode potential of an electrode\\nis greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to\\nhydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative\\nthen hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.\\nIt can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the\\nhighest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F2) has the maximum\\ntendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F–) and therefore fluorine\\ngas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest\\nreducing agent.

The\\nquestion can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction,\\nfor example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team\\ndepend upon the slowest person in the team.  Similarly, the overall rate\\nof the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the\\nrate determining step .

Thus, the rate of formation of\\nintermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.\\nThus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:\\n(i)Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity.

The substance is then called inhibitor . The\\naction of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory.\\nAccording to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by\\nforming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate\\ncomplex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products\\nand the catalyst.\\nIt is believed that the catalyst provides an\\nalternate pathway or reaction mechanism by\\nreducing the activation energy between\\nreactants and products and hence lowering\\nthe potential energy barrier as shown in\\nFig. 3.11.\\nIt is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18)\\nthat lower the value of activation energy faster\\nwill be the rate of a reaction.\\nA small amount of the catalyst can catalyse\\na large amount of reactants. A catalyst does\\nnot alter Gibbs energy, DG of a reaction.  It\\ncatalyses the spontaneous reactions but does\\nnot catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is\\nalso found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of\\na reaction rather , it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster , that is, it\\ncatalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same\\nextent so that the equilibrium state r emains same but is r eached earlier .\\nThough Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of\\ncircumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max  T rautz\\nand William Lewis in 1916 -18, provides a greater insight into the\\nenergetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions. It is based on kinetic\\ntheory of gases.

The number of collisions per\\nsecond per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as\\ncollision frequency (Z) .

Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can\\nsay that A is related to collision frequency.\\nEquation ( 3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly\\naccurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple\\nmolecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are\\nobserved.  The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the\\nformation of products.  The collisions in which molecules collide with\\nsufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper\\norientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting\\nspecies and formation of new bonds to form products are called as\\neffective collisions.\\nFor example, formation of\\nmethanol from bromoethane depends\\nupon the orientation of reactant\\nmolecules as shown in\\nFig. 3.12.

The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration\\nof reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time.  It can\\nbe expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average\\nrate over a large interval of time.  A number of factors such as temperature,\\nconcentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction.  Mathematical\\nrepresentation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law .  It has to be determined\\nexperimentally and cannot be predicted.  Order of a reaction  with respect to\\na reactant is the power of its concentration  which appears in the rate law\\nequation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration\\nof terms for different reactants. Rate constant  is the proportionality factor in\\nthe rate law.  Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate\\nlaw or its integrated rate equation.  Molecularity  is defined only for an elementary\\nreaction.  Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or\\neven a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same.\\nTemperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation\\n(k = Ae–Ea/RT). Ea corr esponds to the activation ener gy and is given by the\\nenergy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A\\n(Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor)  corresponds to  the collision frequency.\\nThe equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of Ea will\\nlead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the\\nactivation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. According to\\ncollision theory, another factor P called steric factor which refers to the orientation\\nof molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions,\\nthus, modifying the Arrhenius equation to a/\\nABZ eE RTk P\\uf02d\\uf03d .\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",

Table\\n4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first\\nseries of transition elements. These values show that the successive\\nenthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as  in the case\\nof non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along\\na series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation\\nalong a period of non-transition elements. T he first ionisation enthalpy,\\nin general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second\\nand third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements,  is much\\nhigher\\n along a series .\\nThe irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of\\n3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for\\nby considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies\\nof 4s and 3 d orbitals. Y ou have lear nt that when d-block elements for m\\nions, ns electrons are lost before ( n – 1) d electrons. As we move along\\nthe period in 3 d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from\\nscandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell,\\ni.e., 3 d orbitals. These 3 d electrons shield the 4 s electrons from the\\nincreasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer\\nshell electr ons can shield one another . Ther efore, the atomic radii\\ndecrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly\\nalong the 3 d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have dn\\nconfigurations with no 4 s electrons. A general trend of increasing values\\nof second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge\\nincreases because one d electron does not shield another electron from\\nthe influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction.\\nHowever , the tr end of steady incr ease in second and thir d ionisation\\nenthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both\\nthe cases, ions have d5 configuration.

Exchange energy is responsible for\\nthe stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately\\nproportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in\\nthe degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of\\ndegenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum\\npossible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds\\nrule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability\\nincreases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of\\nexchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3 d54s1 configuration and\\nconfiguration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower\\nthan Cr+. In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3 d5\\nconfiguration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+.\\nIn other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is\\nlower than that of Mn.\\n The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To\\nform the M2+ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and\\nsecond ionisation  enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of\\natomisation.  The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy\\nwhich shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M+ ions\\nhave the d5 and d10 configurations  respectively . The value for Zn is\\ncorrespondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4 s\\nelectron which results in the formation of stable d10 configuration.\\nThe trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by\\nthe 4 s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an\\nelectron from the d5 (Mn2+) and d10 (Zn2+) ions.  In general, the third\\nionisation enthalpies are quite high.  Also the high values for third\\nionisation enthalpies of copper , nickel and zinc indicate why it is\\ndifficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.\\nAlthough ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the\\nrelative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and\\nnot amenable to ready generalisation.\\nOne of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety\\nof oxidation states these may show in their compounds.

This general trend towards less negative Eo\\nvalues is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second\\nionisation enthalpies.

In fact,\\nferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the\\ntransition metal ions are paramagnetic.\\nParamagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each\\nsuch electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular\\nmomentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the\\nfirst series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular\\nmomentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For\\nthese, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired\\nelectrons and is calculated by using the ‘spin-only’ formula, i.e.,\\n\\uf028 \\uf029nn 2\\uf06d \\uf03d \\uf02b\\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and µ is the magnetic\\nmoment in units of Bohr magneton (BM) . A single unpaired electron\\nhas a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).\\nThe magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of\\nunpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful\\nindication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom,\\nmolecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the ‘spin-only’\\nformula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row\\ntransition elements are given in Table 4.7.

This is due to the comparatively\\nsmaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the\\navailability of d orbitals for bond formation.\\nThe transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic\\nactivity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple\\noxidation states and to for m complexes. V anadium(V) oxide (in Contact\\nProcess), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic\\nHydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface\\ninvolve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms\\nof the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and\\n4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the\\nconcentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening\\nof the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering).\\nAlso because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states,\\nthey become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses\\nthe reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.\\n2 I– + S2O82– ® I2 + 2 SO42–\\nAn explanation of this catalytic action can be given as:\\n2 Fe3+ + 2 I– ® 2 Fe2+ + I2\\n2 Fe2+ + S2O82– ® 2 Fe3+ + 2SO42–\\nInterstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms\\nlike H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are\\nusually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent,\\nfor example, T iC, Mn4N, Fe3H, VH0.56 and T iH1.7, etc. The for mulas\\nquoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of\\nthe metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds\\nare referred to as interstitial  compounds. The principal physical and\\nchemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows:\\n(i)They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.\\n(ii)They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.\\n(iii)They retain metallic conductivity.\\n(iv)They are chemically inert.\\nAn alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components.\\nAlloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one\\nmetal ar e distributed randomly among the atoms of the other . Such\\nalloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15\\npercent of each other . Because of similar radii and other characteristics\\nof transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The\\nalloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points.

In these higher oxides, the acidic\\ncharacter is predominant.\\nThus, Mn2O7 gives HMnO4 and CrO3 gives H2CrO4 and H2Cr2O7.\\nV2O5 is, however , amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO43– as\\nwell as VO2+ salts.

Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is\\nusually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the\\ngeneral symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids\\nincludes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series.\\nThe lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members\\nof ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable\\noxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to\\nexamine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a\\nseries of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on\\nthe other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly\\nowing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these\\nelements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems\\nin their study; the two series will be considered separately here.\\nThe names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some\\nionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids\\n(for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9.4.5 4.54.54.54.5The\\nTheThe TheThe\\nLanthanoids LanthanoidsLanthanoids LanthanoidsLanthanoids\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",

However , the electr onic configurations of all the tripositive\\nions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the\\nform 4 f n (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number).\\nThe overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to\\nlutetium (the lanthanoid contraction ) is a unique feature in the\\nchemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching\\nconsequences in the chemistry of the third\\ntransition series of the elements. The decrease\\nin atomic radii (derived from the structures of\\nmetals) is not quite regular as it is regular in\\nM3+ ions (Fig. 4.6). This contraction is, of\\ncourse, similar to that observed in an ordinary\\ntransition series and is attributed to the same\\ncause, the imperfect shielding of one electron\\nby another in the same sub-shell. However , the\\nshielding of one 4 f electron by another is less\\nthan one d electron by another with the increase\\nin nuclear charge along the series. There is\\nfairly regular decrease in the sizes with\\nincreasing atomic number .\\nThe cumulative effect of the contraction of\\nthe lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid\\ncontraction , causes the radii of the members\\nof the third transition series to be very similar\\nto those of the corresponding members of the\\nsecond series. The almost identical radii of Zr\\n(160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of\\nthe lanthanoid contraction, account for their\\noccurrence together in nature and for the\\ndifficulty faced in their separation.\\nIn the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant\\nspecies. However , occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid\\ncompounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation\\nenthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled\\nor filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of CeIV is favoured by its\\nnoble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the\\ncommon +3 state. The Eo value for Ce4+/ Ce3+ is + 1.74 V which\\nsuggests that it can oxidise water . However , the r eaction rate is very\\nslow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical r eagent. Pr , Nd, Tb and Dy\\nalso exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO2. Eu2+ is formed by losing\\nthe two s electrons and its f 7 configuration accounts for the formation\\nof this ion. However , Eu2+ is a str ong r educing agent changing to the\\ncommon +3 state. Similarly Yb2+ which has f 14 configuration is a\\nreductant. TbIV has half-filled f-orbitals and is an oxidant. The\\nbehaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both\\n+2 and +3 oxidation states.4.5.3 Oxidation\\nStatesFig. 4.6: Trends in ionic radii of lanthanoids\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",

A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation\\nenthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in\\n3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain\\ndegree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals\\nf level.

The lat ter members could be\\nprepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study\\nmore difficult.\\nAll the actinoids are believed to have the electron ic configuration of 7s2\\nand variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons\\nare formally added to 5 f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa\\nonwards the 5 f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in\\nthe electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids\\nare related to the stabilities of the f 0, f 7 and f 14 occupancies of the 5f\\norbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5 f 77s2 and\\n[Rn] 5 f 76d17s2. Although the 5 f orbitals resemble the 4 f orbitals in their\\nangular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4 f orbitals\\nand hence 5 f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.\\nThe general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well.\\nThere is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M3+ ions across the\\nseries. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction  (like lanthanoid\\ncontraction). The contraction is, however , greater fr om element to element\\nin this series resulting from poor shielding by 5 f electrons.\\nThere is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to\\nthe fact that the 5 f, 6d and 7 s\\n levels are of comparable energies. The\\nknown oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11.\\nThe actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the\\nfirst half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example,\\nthe maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7\\nrespectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table\\n4.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds\\nin +3 state than in the +4 state. However , +3 and +4 ions tend to hydr olyse.\\nBecause the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so\\nuneven and so different for the former  and later elements, it is unsatisfactory\\nto review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.4.6.1 Electronic\\nConfigurations\\n4.6.2  Ionic Sizes\\n4.6.3  Oxidation\\nStates\\nThe actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display\\na variety of structures.

Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility\\nof the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5  f electrons is roughly\\nparallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have\\nhigher values.\\nIt is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation\\nenthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are\\nlower than for the early lanthan oids. This is quite reasonable since it is to\\nbe expected that when 5 f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will\\npenetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5 f electrons, will therefore,\\nbe more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f  electrons\\nof the corresponding lanthanoids.

Their melting and boiling points ar e high which ar e attributed\\nto the involvement of ( n–1)d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding .

For example, [CoCl3(NH3)3]\\nis a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by\\nthree ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples\\nare [Ni(CO)4], [PtCl2(NH3)2], [Fe(CN)6]4–, [Co(NH3)6]3+.\\n(b)Central atom/ion\\nIn a coordination entity, the atom/ion to which a fixed number\\nof ions/groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement\\naround it, is called the central atom or ion. For example, the\\ncentral atom/ion in the coordination entities: [NiCl 2(H2O)4],\\n[CoCl(NH3)5]2+ and [Fe(CN)6]3– are Ni2+, Co3+ and Fe3+, respectively.\\nThese central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids .\\n(c)Ligands\\nThe ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the\\ncoordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions\\nsuch as Cl–, small molecules such as H2O or NH3, larger molecules\\nsuch as H2NCH2CH2NH2 or N(CH2CH2NH2)3 or even macromolecules,\\nsuch as proteins.\\nWhen a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor\\natom, as  with Cl–, H2O or NH3, the ligand is said to be unidentate .\\nWhen a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in\\nH2NCH2CH2NH2 (ethane-1,2-diamine) or C2O42– (oxalate), the\\nligand is said to be didentate  and when several donor atoms are\\npresent in a single ligand as in N(CH2CH2NH2)3, the ligand is said\\nto be polydentate . Ethylenediaminetetra acetate ion (EDTA4–) is\\nan important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two\\nnitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion.\\nWhen a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor\\natoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a\\nchelate  ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the\\ndenticity  of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes\\ntend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate\\nligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of\\nthe two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate\\nligand . Examples of such ligands are the NO2– and\\nSCN– ions. NO 2– ion can coordinate either through\\nnitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal\\natom/ion.\\nSimilarly, SCN– ion can coordinate through the\\nsulphur or nitrogen atom.\\n(d)Coordination number\\nThe coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be\\ndefined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is\\ndirectly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, [PtCl6]2– and\\n[Ni(NH3)4]2+, the coordination number of Pt and Ni are 6 and 4\\nrespectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, [Fe(C2O4)3]3– and\\n[Co(en)3]3+, the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because\\nC2O42– and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands.5.2 5.25.2 5.25.2 Definitions ofDefinitions ofDefinitions ofDefinitions ofDefinitions of\\nSome SomeSomeSomeSome\\nImportant\\nImportantImportant ImportantImportant\\nTerms TermsTerms TermsTerms\\nPertaining toPertaining toPertaining toPertaining toPertaining to\\nCoordinationCoordinationCoordinationCoordinationCoordination\\nCompounds CompoundsCompounds CompoundsCompounds\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'),\n",

Pi bonds, if formed between the\\nligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.\\n(e)Coordination sphere\\nThe central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in\\nsquare bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination\\nsphere . The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and\\nare called counter ions. For example, in the complex K4[Fe(CN)6],\\nthe coordination sphere is [Fe(CN)6]4– and the counter ion is K+.\\n(f)Coordination polyhedron\\nThe spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly\\nattached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination\\npolyhedron about the central atom. The most common\\ncoordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and\\ntetrahedral. For example, [Co(NH3)6]3+ is octahedral, [Ni(CO)4] is\\ntetrahedral and [PtCl4]2– is squar e planar .

The\\noxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis\\nfollowing the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation\\nnumber of copper in [Cu(CN) 4]3– is +1 and it is written as Cu(I).\\n(h)Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes\\nComplexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor\\ngroups, e.g., [Co(NH 3)6]3+, are known as homoleptic. Complexes in\\nwhich a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups,\\ne.g., [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+, are known as heteroleptic.\\nNomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the\\nneed to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and\\nwriting systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers.

When mor e than\\nthree 3 d electrons are present, the required pair of 3 d orbitals for\\noctahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of\\nHund’s rule). Thus, for d4 (Cr2+, Mn3+), d5 (Mn2+, Fe3+), d6 (Fe2+, Co3+)\\ncases, a vacant pair of d orbitals results only by pairing of 3 d electrons\\nwhich leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively.\\nThe magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases,\\nespecially with coor dination compounds containing d6 ions.

Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.\\n(a)Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities\\nIn an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding\\nthe metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in\\nmetal d orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands.\\nSuch a repulsion is more when the metal d  orbital is directed towards\\nthe ligand than when it is away from the ligand.

For d4 ions, two possible\\npatterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could\\neither enter the t2g level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it\\ncould avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the\\neg level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative\\nmagnitude of the crystal field splitting, Do and the pairing energy, P\\n(P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single\\norbital).

For over 7000 years, India has had a\\nrich tradition of metallurgical skills.\\nThe two important sources for the history of Indian\\nmetallurgy are archaeological excavations and literary\\nevidences.

The ore for extraction of metal for\\nmaking the objects was obtained from chalcopyrite ore deposits in\\nAravalli Hills. Collection of ar chaeological texts fr om copper -plates and\\nrock-inscriptions have been compiled and published by the\\nArchaeological Survey of India during the past century.

It is interesting that the availability of alluvial\\nplacer gold in the river Sindhu has been reported in modern times also.\\nIt has been reported that there are great mines of gold in the region of\\nMansarovar and in Thokjalyug even now. The Pali  text, Anguttara Nikaya\\nnarrates the process of the recovery of gold dust or particles from alluvial\\nplacer gold deposits. Although evidence of gold refining is available in\\nVedic texts, it is Kautilya’s Arthashastra , author ed pr obably in 3r d or\\n4th century BCE, during Mauryan era, which has much data on\\nprevailing chemical practices in a long section on mines and minerals\\nincluding metal or es of gold, silver , copper , lead, tin and ir on. Kautilya\\ndescribes a variety of gold called rasviddha , which is naturally occurring\\ngold solution . Kalidas  also mentioned about such solutions.

Therefore, reduced iron blocks are also called\\nsponge iron blocks. Any useful product can be obtained from this\\nmaterial only after removing the porosity by hot forging.

Before proceeding\\nfor concentration, ores are graded and crushed to reasonable size.\\nConcentration of ores involves several steps and selection of these steps\\ndepends upon the differences in physical properties of the compound of\\nthe metal present and that of the gangue. The type of the metal, the\\navailable facilities and the environmental factors are also taken into\\nconsideration. Some of the important procedures for concentration of\\nore are described below.\\nThis is based on the difference between specific gravities of the ore and\\nthe gangue  particles. It is therefore a type of gravity separation . In one\\nsuch process, an upward stream of running water is used to wash the\\npowdered ore. The lighter gangue particles are washed away and the\\nheavier ore particles are left behind.\\nThis is based on differences in magnetic properties of the ore\\ncomponents. If either the ore or the gangue is attracted towards\\nmagnetic field, then the separation is\\ncarried out by this method. For example\\niron ores are attracted towards magnet,\\nhence, non–magnetic impurities can be\\nseparted from them using magnetic\\nseparation.

It is interest ing to note here that ∆H (enthalpy change) and the ∆S (entropy\\nchange) values for any chemical reaction remain nearly constant even on varying\\ntemperatur e. So the only dominant variable in equation(6.14) becomes T. However , ∆S\\ndepends much on the physical state of the compound.

The metal oxide reacts with a reducing agent; the\\noxide is reduced to the metal and the reducing agent is oxidised. In the two reactions,\\nthe net Gibbs energy change is negative, which becomes more negative on raising\\nthe temperature. Conversion of the physical states from solid to liquid or to gas,\\nand formation of gaseous states favours decrease in the Gibbs energy for the entire\\nsystem. This concept is graphically displayed in plots of ∆G0 vs T (Ellingham diagram)\\nfor such oxidation/reduction reactions at different temperatures. The concept of\\nelectrode potential is useful in the isolation of metals (e.g., Al, Ag, Au) where the\\nsum of the two redox couples is positive so that the Gibbs energy change is negative.\\nThe metals obtained by usual methods still contain minor impurities. Getting pure\\nmetals requires refining . Refining process depends upon the differences in\\nproperties of the metal and the impurities. Extraction of aluminium is usually carried\\nout from its bauxite ore by leaching it with NaOH. Sodium aluminate, thus formed,\\nis separated and then neutralised to give back the hydrated oxide, which is then\\nelectrolysed using cryolite as a flux. Extraction of iron is done by reduction of its\\noxide ore in blast furnace. Copper is extracted by smelting and heating in a\\nreverberatory furnace. Extraction of zinc from zinc oxides is done using coke. Several\\nmethods are employed in refining the metal.

Metallic character increases down the group.\\nNitrogen and phosphorus are non-metals, arsenic and antimony metalloids\\nand bismuth is a metal. This is due to decrease in ionisation enthalpy and\\nincrease in atomic size.

It is due to increase in\\nsize. However , the elements of this gr oup have lower ionisation enthalpy\\nvalues compared to those of Group15 in the corresponding periods.\\nThis is due to the fact that Group 15 elements have extra stable half-\\nfilled p orbitals electronic configurations.\\nBecause of the compact nature of oxygen atom, it has less negative\\nelectr on gain enthalpy than sulphur . However , from sulphur onwar ds\\nthe value again becomes less negative upto polonium.\\nNext to fluorine, oxygen has the highest electronegativity value amongst\\nthe elements. Within the group, electronegativity decreases with an\\nincrease in atomic number . This implies that the metallic character\\nincreases from oxygen to polonium.\\nSome of the physical properties of Group 16 elements are given in\\nTable 7.6. Oxygen and sulphur are non-metals, selenium and tellurium\\nmetalloids, whereas polonium is a metal. Polonium is radioactive and\\nis short lived (Half-life 13.8 days). All these elements exhibit allotropy.\\nThe melting and boiling points increase with an increase in atomic\\nnumber down the group. The large difference between the melting and\\nboiling points of oxygen and sulphur may be explained on the basis\\nof their atomicity; oxygen exists as diatomic molecule (O2) whereas\\nsulphur exists as polyatomic molecule (S8).\\nOxidation states and trends in chemical reactivity\\nThe elements of Group 16 exhibit a number of oxidation states (Table\\n7.6). The stability of -2 oxidation state decreases down the group.\\nPolonium hardly shows –2 oxidation state. Since electronegativity of\\noxygen is very high, it shows only negative oxidation state as –2 except\\nin the case of OF2 where its oxidation state is + 2. Other elements of the\\ngroup exhibit + 2, + 4, + 6 oxidation states but + 4 and + 6 are more\\ncommon. Sulphur , selenium and tellurium usually show + 4 oxidation\\nstate in their compounds with oxygen and + 6 with fluorine. The stability\\nof + 6 oxidation state decreases down the group and stability of + 4\\noxidation state increases (inert pair effect).

Fluorine\\nand chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid. Their\\nmelting and boiling points steadily incr ease with atomic number . All\\nhalogens are coloured. This is due to absorption of radiations in visible\\nregion which results in the excitation of outer electrons to higher energy\\nlevel. By absorbing different quanta of radiation, they display different\\ncolours. For example, F2, has yellow, Cl2 , greenish yellow, Br2, red and\\nI2, violet colour . Fluorine and chlorine r eact with water . Bromine and\\niodine are only sparingly soluble in water but are soluble in various\\norganic solvents such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon\\ndisulphide and hydrocarbons to give coloured solutions.\\nOne curious anomaly we notice from Table 7.8 is the smaller\\nenthalpy of dissociation of F2 compared to that of Cl2 whereas X-X\\nbond dissociation enthalpies from chlorine onwards show the expected\\ntrend: Cl – Cl > Br – Br > I – I. A reason for this anomaly is the relatively\\nlarge electron-electron repulsion among the lone pairs in F2 molecule\\nwhere they are much closer to each other than in case of Cl2.\\n2022-23\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Doc\\\\lech107.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='200 ChemistryThe higher oxidation states of chlorine, bromine and iodine are realised\\nmainly when the halogens are in combination with the small and highly\\nelectronegative fluorine and oxygen atoms. e.g., in interhalogens, oxides\\nand oxoacids. The oxidation states of +4 and +6 occur in the oxides and\\noxoacids of chlorine and bromine. The fluorine atom has no d orbitals\\nin its valence shell and therefore cannot expand its octet. Being the most\\nelectronegative, it exhibits only –1 oxidation state.\\nAll the halogens are highly reactive. They react with metals and\\nnon-metals to form halides. The reactivity of the halogens decreases\\ndown the group.\\nThe ready acceptance of an electron is the reason for the strong\\noxidising nature of halogens. F2 is the strongest oxidising halogen and\\nit oxidises other halide ions in solution or even in the solid phase. In\\ngeneral, a halogen oxidises halide ions of higher atomic number .\\nF2 + 2X– → 2F– + X2 (X = Cl, Br or I)\\nCl2 + 2X– → 2Cl– + X2 (X = Br or I)\\nBr2 + 2I– → 2Br– + I2\\nThe decreasing oxidising ability of the halogens in aqueous solution\\ndown the group is evident from their standard electrode potentials\\n(Table 7.8) which are dependent on the parameters indicated below:\\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )eg hyd diss 1/2\\n21X g X g X g Xaq2H H H – – ∆ ∆ ∆\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7 → \\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7 → \\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7 \\uf8e7 →V V V\\nThe relative oxidising power of halogens can further be illustrated\\nby their r eactions with water . Fluorine oxidises water to oxygen wher eas\\nchlorine and bromine react with water to form corresponding hydrohalic\\nand hypohalous acids. The reaction of iodine with water is non-\\nspontaneous.

For example, ionisation\\nenthalpy, electronegativity, and electrode potentials are all higher for\\nfluorine than expected from the trends set by other halogens. Also, ionic\\nand covalent radii, m.p. and b.p., enthalpy of bond dissociation and electron\\ngain enthalpy are quite lower than expected. The anomalous behaviour of\\nfluorine is due to its small size, highest electronegativity, low F-F bond\\ndissociation enthalpy, and non availability of  d orbitals in valence shell.\\nMost of the reactions of fluorine are exothermic (due to the small\\nand strong bond formed by it with other elements). It forms only one\\noxoacid while other halogens form a number of oxoacids.

Fluorine forms two oxides OF 2 and\\nO2F2. However, only OF2 is ther mally stable at 298 K. These oxides\\nare essentially oxygen fluorides because of the higher\\nelectronegativity of fluorine than oxygen. Both are strong fluorinating\\nagents. O2F2 oxidises plutonium to PuF6 and the reaction is used\\nin removing plutonium as PuF6 from spent nuclear fuel.\\nChlorine, bromine and iodine form oxides in which the oxidation\\nstates of these halogens range from +1 to +7. A combination of kinetic\\nand thermodynamic factors lead to the generally decreasing order of\\nstability of oxides for med by halogens, I > Cl > Br . Higher stability of\\noxides of iodine is due to greater polarisability of bond between\\niodine and oxygen. In the case of chlorine, multiple bond formation\\nbetween chlorine and oxygen takes place due to availability of\\nd–orbitals. This leads to increase in stability. Bromine lacks both the\\ncharacteristics hence stability of oxides of bromine is least. The higher\\noxides of halogens tend to be more stable than the lower ones.\\nChlorine oxides, Cl2O, ClO2, Cl2O6 and Cl2O7 are highly reactive\\noxidising agents and tend to explode. ClO2 is used as a bleaching\\nagent for paper pulp and textiles and in water treatment.\\nThe bromine oxides, Br2O, BrO2 , BrO3 are the least stable\\nhalogen oxides (middle row anomally) and exist only at low\\ntemperatures. They are very powerful oxidising agents.\\nThe iodine oxides, I2O4 , I2O5, I2O7 are insoluble solids and\\ndecompose on heating.

In March\\n1962, Neil Bartlett, then at the University of British Columbia, observed\\nthe reaction of a noble gas. First, he prepared a red compound which\\nis formulated as O 2+PtF 6–. He, then realised that the first ionisation\\nenthalpy of molecular oxygen (1175 kJmol–1) was almost identical with\\nthat of xenon (1170 kJ mol–1). He made efforts to prepare same type of\\ncompound with Xe and was successful in preparing another red colour\\ncompound Xe+PtF 6– by mixing PtF 6 and xenon.

Groups 13 and 14 were dealt with in Class\\nXI. In this Unit  remaining groups of the p-block have been discussed.\\nGroup 15  consists of five elements namely, N, P , As, Sb and Bi which have\\ngeneral electronic configuration ns2np3. Nitrogen differs from other elements of this\\ngroup due to small size,  formation of pπ ππ ππ–pπ ππ ππ multiple bonds  with itself and with\\nhighly electronegative atom like O or C and non-availability of d orbitals  to expand\\nits valence shell. Elements of group 15 show gradation in properties. They react with\\noxygen, hydrogen and halogens. They exhibit two important oxidation states, + 3\\nand + 5 but +3 oxidation is favoured by heavier elements due to ‘inert pair effect’.\\nDinitrogen can be prepared in laboratory as well as on industrial scale. It forms\\noxides in various oxidation states as N2O, NO, N2O3, NO2, N2O4 and N2O5. These\\noxides have resonating structures  and have multiple bonds. Ammonia can be\\nprepared on large scale by Haber’s process . HNO3 is an important industrial\\nchemical. It is a strong monobasic acid and is a powerful oxidising agent. Metals\\nand non-metals react with HNO3 under different conditions to give NO or NO2.\\nPhosphorus exists as P4 in elemental form. It exists in several allotropic forms .\\nIt forms hydride, PH3 which is a highly poisonous gas. It forms two types of halides as\\nPX3 and PX5. PCl3 is prepared by the reaction of white phosphorus with dry chlorine\\nwhile PCl5 is prepared by the reaction of phosphorus with SO2Cl2. Phosphorus forms\\na number of oxoacids. Depending upon the number of P–OH groups, their basicity\\nvaries. The oxoacids which have P–H bonds are good  reducing agents.\\nThe Group 16  elements have general electronic configuration ns2np4. They show\\nmaximum oxidation state, +6. Gradation in physical and chemical properties is\\nobserved in the group 16 elements. In laboratory , dioxygen is prepared by heating\\nKClO3 in presence of MnO2. It forms a number of oxides with metals. Allotropic form\\nof oxygen is O3 which is a highly oxidi sing agent. Sulphur forms a number of allotropes.\\nOf these, α– and β– forms of sulphur are the most important. Sulphur combines with\\noxygen to give oxides such as SO2 and SO3. SO2 is prepared by the direct union of\\nsulphur with oxygen. SO2 is used in the manufacture of H2SO4. Sulphur forms a\\nnumber of oxoacids. Amongst them , the most important is H2SO4. It is prepared by\\ncontact process . It is a dehydrating and oxidising agent. It is used in the manufacture\\nof several compounds.\\nGroup 17  of the periodic table consists of the following elements F , Cl, Br , I and\\nAt.These elements are extremely reactive and as such they are found in the\\ncombined state only. The common oxidation state of these elements is –1. However ,\\nhighest oxidation state can be +7. They show regular gradation in physical and\\nchemical properties. They form oxides, hydrogen halides, interhalogen compounds\\nand oxoacids. Chlorine is conveniently obtained by the reaction of HCl with KMnO4.\\nHCl is prepared by heating NaCl with concentrated H2SO4. Halogens combine with\\none another to form interhalogen compounds  of the type XX1\\nn (n = 1, 3, 5, 7)\\nwhere X1 is lighter than X. A number of oxoacids of halogens are known. In the\\nstructures of these oxoacids, halogen is the central atom which is bonded in each\\ncase with one OH bond as X–OH. In some cases X = 0 bonds are also found.\\nGroup 18  of the periodic table consists of noble gases . They have ns2\\n np6 valence\\nshell electronic configuration except He which has 1 s2. All the gases except Rn\\noccur in atmosphere. Rn is obtained as the decay product of 226Ra.\\nDue to complete octet of outermost shell, they have less tendency to form\\ncompounds. The best characterised compounds are those of xenon with fluorine\\nand oxygen only under certain conditions. These gases have several uses. Argon is\\nused to provide inert atmosphere, helium is used in filling balloons for meteorological\\nobservations, neon is used in discharge tubes and fluorescent bulbs.\\n2022-23\\n'),\n",

Furthermore,\\nhalf and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A\\nconsequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations\\nof Cr and Cu in the 3 d series.

Table\\n8.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first\\nseries of transition elements. These values show that the successive\\nenthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as  in the case\\nof non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along\\na series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation\\nalong a period of non-transition elements. T he first ionisation enthalpy,\\nin general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second\\nand third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements,  is much\\nhigher  along a series .\\nThe irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of\\n3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for\\nby considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies\\nof 4s and 3 d orbitals. Y ou have lear nt that when d-block elements for m\\nions, ns electrons are lost before ( n – 1) d electrons. As we move along\\nthe period in 3 d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from\\nscandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell,\\ni.e., 3 d orbitals. These 3 d electrons shield the 4 s electrons from the\\nincreasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer\\nshell electr ons can shield one another . Ther efore, the atomic radii\\ndecrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly\\nalong the 3 d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have dn\\nconfigurations with no 4 s electrons. A general trend of increasing values\\nof second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge\\nincreases because one d electron does not shield another electron from\\nthe influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction.\\nHowever , the tr end of steady incr ease in second and thir d ionisation\\nenthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both\\nthe cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at\\ncorresponding elements in the later transition series.\\nThe interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic\\nconfiguration dn is as follows:\\nThe three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are\\nattraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the8.3.3 Ionisation\\nEnthalpies\\nIntext QuestionIntext QuestionIntext QuestionIntext QuestionIntext Question\\n8.2In the series Sc ( Z = 21) to Zn ( Z = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation\\nof zinc is the lowest, i.e., 126 kJ mol–1.

Exchange energy is responsible for\\nthe stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately\\nproportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in\\nthe degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of\\ndegenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum\\npossible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds\\nrule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability\\nincreases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of\\nexchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3 d54s1 configuration and\\nconfiguration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower\\nthan Cr+. In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3 d5\\nconfiguration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+.\\nIn other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is\\nlower than that of Mn.\\n The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To\\nform the M2+ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and\\nsecond ionisation  enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of\\natomisation.  The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy\\nwhich shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M+ ions\\nhave the d5 and d10 configurations  respectively . The value for Zn is\\ncorrespondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4 s\\nelectron which results in the formation of stable d10 configuration.\\nThe trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by\\nthe 4 s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an\\nelectron from the d5 (Mn2+) and d10 (Zn2+) ions.  In general, the third\\nionisation enthalpies are quite high.  Also the high values for third\\nionisation enthalpies of copper , nickel and zinc indicate why it is\\ndifficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.\\nAlthough ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the\\nrelative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and\\nnot amenable to ready generalisation.\\nOne of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety\\nof oxidation states these may show in their compounds.

In fact,\\nferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the\\ntransition metal ions are paramagnetic.\\nParamagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each\\nsuch electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular\\nmomentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the\\nfirst series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular\\nmomentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance.

This is due to the comparatively\\nsmaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the\\navailability of d orbitals for bond formation.\\nThe transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic\\nactivity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple\\noxidation states and to for m complexes. V anadium(V) oxide (in Contact\\nProcess), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic\\nHydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface\\ninvolve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms\\nof the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and\\n4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the\\nconcentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening\\nof the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering).\\nAlso because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states,\\nthey become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses\\nthe reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.\\n2 I– + S 2O82– → I2 + 2 SO 42–\\nAn explanation of this catalytic action can be given as:\\n2 Fe3+ + 2 I– → 2 Fe2+ + I2\\n2 Fe2+ + S2O82– → 2 Fe3+ + 2SO42–\\nInterstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms\\nlike H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals.

Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is\\nusually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the\\ngeneral symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids\\nincludes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series.\\nThe lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members\\nof ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable\\noxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to\\nexamine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a\\nseries of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on\\nthe other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly\\nowing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these\\nelements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems\\nin their study; the two series will be considered separately here.\\nThe names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some\\nionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids\\n(for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 8.9.8.5 8.58.5 8.58.5 The TheTheTheThe\\nLanthanoids\\nLanthanoidsLanthanoids LanthanoidsLanthanoids\\n2022-23\\n'),\n",

However , the electr onic configurations of all the tripositive\\nions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the\\nform 4 f n (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number).\\nThe overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to\\nlutetium (the lanthanoid contraction ) is a unique feature in the\\nchemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching\\nconsequences in the chemistry of the third\\ntransition series of the elements. The decrease\\nin atomic radii (derived from the structures of\\nmetals) is not quite regular as it is regular in\\nM3+ ions (Fig. 8.6). This contraction is, of\\ncourse, similar to that observed in an ordinary\\ntransition series and is attributed to the same\\ncause, the imperfect shielding of one electron\\nby another in the same sub-shell. However , the\\nshielding of one 4 f electron by another is less\\nthan one d electron by another with the increase\\nin nuclear charge along the series. There is\\nfairly regular decrease in the sizes with\\nincreasing atomic number .\\nThe cumulative effect of the contraction of\\nthe lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid\\ncontraction , causes the radii of the members\\nof the third transition series to be very similar\\nto those of the corresponding members of the\\nsecond series. The almost identical radii of Zr\\n(160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of\\nthe lanthanoid contraction, account for their\\noccurrence together in nature and for the\\ndifficulty faced in their separation.\\nIn the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant\\nspecies. However , occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid\\ncompounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation\\nenthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled\\nor filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of CeIV is favoured by its\\nnoble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the\\ncommon +3 state. The Eo value for Ce4+/ Ce3+ is + 1.74 V which\\nsuggests that it can oxidise water . However , the r eaction rate is very\\nslow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical r eagent. Pr , Nd, Tb and Dy\\nalso exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO2. Eu2+ is formed by losing\\nthe two s electrons and its f 7 configuration accounts for the formation\\nof this ion.

The lat ter members could be\\nprepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study\\nmore difficult.\\nAll the actinoids are believed to have the electron ic configuration of 7s2\\nand variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons\\nare formally added to 5 f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa\\nonwards the 5 f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in\\nthe electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids\\nare related to the stabilities of the f 0, f 7 and f 14 occupancies of the 5f\\norbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5 f 77s2 and\\n[Rn] 5 f 76d17s2. Although the 5 f orbitals resemble the 4 f orbitals in their\\nangular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4 f orbitals\\nand hence 5 f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.\\nThe general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well.\\nThere is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M3+ ions across the\\nseries. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction  (like lanthanoid\\ncontraction). The contraction is, however , greater fr om element to element\\nin this series resulting from poor shielding by 5 f electrons.\\nThere is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to\\nthe fact that the 5 f, 6d and 7 s levels are of comparable energies. The\\nknown oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 8.11.\\nThe actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the\\nfirst half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example,\\nthe maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7\\nrespectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table\\n8.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds\\nin +3 state than in the +4 state. However , +3 and +4 ions tend to hydr olyse.\\nBecause the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so\\nuneven and so different for the former  and later elements, it is unsatisfactory\\nto review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.8.6.1 Electronic\\nConfigurations\\n8.6.2  Ionic Sizes\\n8.6.3  Oxidation\\nStates\\nThe actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display\\na variety of structures.

Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility\\nof the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5  f electrons is roughly\\nparallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have\\nhigher values.\\nIt is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation\\nenthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are\\nlower than for the early lanthan oids. This is quite reasonable since it is to\\nbe expected that when 5 f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will\\npenetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5 f electrons, will therefore,\\nbe more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4 f electrons\\nof the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less\\nfirmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.\\nA comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to\\ndifferent characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar\\nto that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the\\nactinoid series.

Their melting and boiling points ar e high which ar e attributed\\nto the involvement of ( n–1)d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding . In\\nmany of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which\\nindicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration\\nfor strong interatomic interaction.\\nSuccessive ionisation enthalpies  do not increase as steeply as in the main group\\nelements with incr easing atomic number . Hence, the loss of variable number of electr ons\\nfrom ( n–1)d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable.

For example, [CoCl3(NH3)3]\\nis a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by\\nthree ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples\\nare [Ni(CO)4], [PtCl2(NH3)2], [Fe(CN)6]4–, [Co(NH3)6]3+.\\n(b)Central atom/ion\\nIn a coordination entity, the atom/ion to which a fixed number\\nof ions/groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement\\naround it, is called the central atom or ion. For example, the\\ncentral atom/ion in the coordination entities: [NiCl2(H2O)4],\\n[CoCl(NH3)5]2+ and [Fe(CN)6]3– are Ni2+, Co3+ and Fe3+, respectively.\\nThese central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids .\\n(c)Ligands\\nThe ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the\\ncoordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions\\nsuch as Cl–, small molecules such as H2O or NH3, larger molecules\\nsuch as H 2NCH 2CH 2NH 2 or N(CH 2CH 2NH 2)3 or even macromolecules,\\nsuch as proteins.\\nWhen a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor\\natom, as  with Cl–, H2O or NH3, the ligand is said to be unidentate .\\nWhen a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in\\nH2NCH2CH2NH2 (ethane-1,2-diamine) or C2O42– (oxalate), the\\nligand is said to be didentate  and when several donor atoms are\\npresent in a single ligand as in N(CH 2CH 2NH 2)3, the ligand is said\\nto be polydentate . Ethylenediaminetetra acetate ion (EDTA4–) is\\nan important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two\\nnitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion.\\nWhen a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor\\natoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a\\nchelate  ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the\\ndenticity  of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes\\ntend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate\\nligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of\\nthe two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate\\nligand . Examples of such ligands are the NO2– and\\nSCN– ions. NO2– ion can coordinate either through\\nnitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal\\natom/ion.\\nSimilarly, SCN– ion can coordinate through the\\nsulphur or nitrogen atom.\\n(d)Coordination number\\nThe coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be\\ndefined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is\\ndirectly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, [PtCl 6]2– and\\n[Ni(NH3)4]2+, the coordination number of Pt and Ni are 6 and 4\\nrespectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, [Fe(C2O4)3]3– and\\n[Co(en) 3]3+, the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because\\nC2O42– and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands.9.2 9.29.2 9.29.2 Definitions ofDefinitions ofDefinitions ofDefinitions ofDefinitions of\\nSomeSomeSome\\nSomeSome\\nImportant ImportantImportant ImportantImportant\\nTerms TermsTerms TermsTerms\\nPertaining toPertaining toPertaining toPertaining toPertaining to\\nCoordinationCoordinationCoordinationCoordinationCoordination\\nCompounds CompoundsCompounds CompoundsCompounds\\n2022-23\\n'),\n",

Pi bonds, if formed between the\\nligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.\\n(e)Coordination sphere\\nThe central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in\\nsquare bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination\\nsphere . The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and\\nare called counter ions. For example, in the complex K4[Fe(CN)6],\\nthe coordination sphere is [Fe(CN)6]4– and the counter ion is K+.\\n(f)Coordination polyhedron\\nThe spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly\\nattached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination\\npolyhedron about the central atom. The most common\\ncoordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and\\ntetrahedral. For example, [Co(NH3)6]3+ is octahedral, [Ni(CO)4] is\\ntetrahedral and [PtCl4]2– is square planar .

The\\noxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis\\nfollowing the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation\\nnumber of copper in [Cu(CN)4]3– is +1 and it is written as Cu(I).\\n(h)Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes\\nComplexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor\\ngroups, e.g., [Co(NH3)6]3+, are known as homoleptic. Complexes in\\nwhich a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups,\\ne.g., [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+, are known as heteroleptic.\\nNomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the\\nneed to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and\\nwriting systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers.
